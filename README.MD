## Description
Magic engines is a pre-alpha minecraft mod focusing on realistic (enough) physics and in world casting interaction. Ironically, this mod is so early released that none of the actual physics has been implemented yet and it's mostly just framework. Development is inconsistent and sporradic because it is a passion project
