## Description
Magic engines is a pre-alpha minecraft mod focusing on realistic (enough) physics and in world casting interaction. Ironically, this mod is so early released that none of the actual physics has been implemented yet and it's mostly just framework. Development is relatively consistent but the devs do have professional lives, so the mod will still take months until it is in a state playable enough in survival to be considered a proper alpha.
